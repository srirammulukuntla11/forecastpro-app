# Sales & Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using historical retail sales data.
Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses plan inventory, manage supply chains, and improve decision-making.

## Dataset
Superstore Sales Dataset containing historical order-level sales data.

## Objective
To analyze past sales trends and build a machine learning model that predicts future sales.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Monthly sales aggregation
- Time-series based train-test split
- Linear Regression model for sales forecasting
- Model evaluation using visual analysis and error metrics

## Results
The model successfully captures the overall sales trend and provides reasonable future sales predictions.
While short-term fluctuations are not perfectly predicted, the model performs well for long-term forecasting.

## Business Insights
- Sales data shows an overall increasing trend, indicating business growth over time.
- Monthly sales fluctuate due to seasonal demand and market conditions.
- The forecasting model captures long-term sales patterns useful for inventory and resource planning.
- Although short-term spikes are not perfectly predicted, the model provides reliable high-level demand estimates.
- Businesses can use these forecasts to avoid overstocking and understocking.

## Limitations
- Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship and cannot fully capture seasonal spikes.
- External factors such as promotions and holidays are not included.

## Future Improvements
- Implement advanced time-series models such as ARIMA or Prophet.
- Include external features like holidays, promotions, and regional trends.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
